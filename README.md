## About
This is a 100% serious project, and it is made to help the community. I figured it out that people also would like to know when a number is odd, and with the npm package [@samuelmarina/is-even](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@samuelmarina/is-even) it was not completely clear, so I decided to create this one as well. Remember, all this hard work is because I care about the community
